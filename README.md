# Anomaly_detection-in-Transactions

This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in financial transaction data. By analyzing transaction patterns and using machine learning, it can flag suspicious or outlier transactions that might indicate fraud or errors.

The project follows a simple workflow:

->Data Visualization: Visualize the transaction data using charts to uncover trends and identify potential outliers.
->Model Training: Train an Isolation Forest model on the dataset to learn the normal behavior of transactions.
->Anomaly Detection: The trained model identifies anomalous transactions, which are flagged as potential fraud or irregular activity.
->The goal of this project is to provide an automated solution for detecting unusual transactions and improving the efficiency of fraud detection systems.

Key Features
* Data Visualization: Understand transaction distributions and trends using visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.
* Anomaly Detection: Train an Isolation Forest model to detect and flag anomalous transactions based on their features.
* Scalable: The model can be applied to various datasets with different features, making it adaptable to various use cases.
